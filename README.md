### 🎯 My favourite quote of all time 
> <b><i> "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend" </bi></i> </br> <i>- Bruce Lee </i>
